### Login

To log in, enter your credentials below:

<form action="/login" method="POST">
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username" placeholder="Username" required>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required>
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>

---

> Note: The form above uses HTML because forms are not supported in pure Markdown.

---

### Custom Styling
If you want to use the same `LoginStyle.css`, you can reference it in an `.html` file. Markdown itself doesn't support linking to external stylesheets.

---

If you want this hosted on GitHub Pages or rendered dynamically, you'd likely need to stick to an `.html` file or integrate Markdown processing with a static site generator like Jekyll.
